In this app, we have a target sequence of "DNA", and we are presented with DNA fragments, which we must use to construct that DNA strand. Our task is to construct the DNA strand with as few fragments as possible.

This app uses Dynamic Programming, a facet of machine learning, where the compiler optimizes based on the return values of the potential solutions.
